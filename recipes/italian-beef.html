    <h3>Crock Pot Italian Beef</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes. It's really easy to make and is a hit at pot lucks or family dinners.</p>
    <p>The ingredient list below is a very loose list with the ability to replace certain ingredients to your liking. This recipe will need a 6qt Crock Pot/Slow Cooker or Pressure Cooker and should serve about 15-20 people, or maybe 3 of me.</p>
