    <h3>Crock Pot Italian Beef</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Servings: 15-20</li>
        <li>Prep Time: < 20 min </li>
        <li>Cook Time: 8 hrs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes. It's really easy to make and is a hit at pot lucks or family dinners.</p>
    <p>The ingredient list below is a very loose list with the ability to replace certain ingredients to your liking. For instance, My recipe includes using fresh herbs because I think that it adds to the fresh flavor of the beef. Feel free to use dried herbs as a replacement. If you do use dried herbs, make sure to use less than the servings I suggest. I would probably cut the amount in half for dried herbs. This recipe will need a 6qt Crock Pot/Slow Cooker or Pressure Cooker and should serve about 15-20C people, or maybe 3 of me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Also, my recipe will vary most conventional recipies for Italian Beef because I add the element of Toasted Garlic Bread w/Cheese. It's a game changer imo.</p>
    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 lbs Chuck Roast, or a leaner cut if you'd like</li>
        <li>4 tbsp EVOO</li>
        <li>2 qts Beef Broth</li>
        <li>2 pouches of dried italian dressing mix</li>
        <li>1 bunch of fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 bunch of fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 bunch of fresh oregano</li>
        <li>3-4 tspn minced garlic or garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tub of garlic butter</li>
        <li>15-20 hoagie rolls</li>
        <li>24-48oz of shredded provolone cheese</li>
        <li>16oz of shredded parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 jar of sliced Pepperoncini</li>
        <li>1 jar of Giardiniera</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Cooking Instructions:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First you'll want to sear the roast in a skillet and create a crust on all sides. Preheat a skillet and heat up some olive oil in the pan. Season your roast with salt and pepper, and/or garlic powder if you'd like. Make sure to trim any access silver skin or hard fat off of your roast before you sear it.</li>
        <li>After searing your meat on all sides, place the roast into your crockpot and turn your crockpot on high, or preset your cooking time to allow for about 8 hrs on high, or 12 hours on low.</li>
        <li>Pour in 2 quarts of Beef Broth into the cooker. Or you'll want to at least use enough broth so that the roast is completely covered by liquid.</li>
        <li>Mix in your dry pouches of Italian Dressing Mix.</li>
        <li>Mix in your remaining minced garlic or garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Chop all of your fresh herbs and remove stems as you go. After chopping them all down, dump them into the crock pot. It really doesn't matter if they are finely chopped or not. They will all cook down.</li>
        <li>Put your lid on the Crock Pot and let it cook for 8-12 hrs depending on your settings. The longer, the better.</li>    
        <li>Once you've cooked the meat, there will be a lot of fat at the top of your liquid and the roast will need broken apart with excess fat removed from the pot. This is a shredded beef recipe, so feel free to break it all up at this point.</li>
        <li>Next, You'll start on your garlic rolls. This can obviously be done while the beef is cooking, or after depending on when this will be served.</li>
        <li>For a softer Hoagie roll, coat both inner sides of the rolls with garlic butter and toast them open side down on a skillet until they're well toasted.</li>
        <li>For a harder Hoagie that will take more juice better, coat the inner sides with the garlic butter, added shredded provolone and parmesan cheeses, salt and pepper, then bake them in a 325Â°F oven until they are well browned and somewhat crispy. This will be great when you assemble your sandwich then dip the sandwich into the broth. It will hold together well and add to the texture and flavor.</li>
        <li>Use the remaining cheeses, Pepperoncini, and Giardiniera as toppings when you assemble the sandwiches.</li>
    </ol>
