    <h3>Crock Pot Italian Beef</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Servings: 15-20</li>
        <li>Prep Time: < 20 min </li>
        <li>Cook Time: 8 hrs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes. It's really easy to make and is a hit at pot lucks or family dinners.</p>
    <p>The ingredient list below is a very loose list with the ability to replace certain ingredients to your liking. For instance, My recipe includes using fresh herbs because I think that it adds to the fresh flavor of the beef. Feel free to use dried herbs as a replacement. If you do use dried herbs, make sure to use less than the servings I suggest. I would probably cut the amount in half for dried herbs. This recipe will need a 6qt Crock Pot/Slow Cooker or Pressure Cooker and should serve about 15-20C people, or maybe 3 of me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Also, my recipe will vary most conventional recipies for Italian Beef because I add the element of Toasted Garlic Bread w/Cheese. It's a game changer imo.</p>
