    <h3>Baked Mac-n-Cheese</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes. It's really easy to make and is a hit at pot lucks or family dinners.</p>
    <p>The ingredient list below is a very loose list with the ability to replace certain ingredients to your liking. This recipe will need a 9x13" baking dish and should serve about 8-10 people, or maybe 3 of me.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16oz dried elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>6 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>6 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>4 cups of Vitamin D Whole Milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>tsp of garlic powder</li>
        <li>tsp of onion powder</li>
        <li>tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>tbsp mustard powder</li>
        <li>12oz shredded sharp cheddar</li>
        <li>8oz smoked gouda</li>
        <li>8oz mozzerella</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>3-4 large bay leaves</li>
        <li>1/2oz of dried or fresh cut parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large stock pot, boil a bunch of water. Add the bay leaves and salt the water. Once the water is at a rolling boil, add the 16oz of macaroni noodles and cook the noodles until al dente. Make sure not to over cook the noodles as they will finish softening while baking. Once done boiling the noodles, strain the noodles with cold water and set aside.</li>
        <li>While boiling your water, preheat your oven to 350Â°F.</li>
        <li>In another large pot, melt the 6 tablespoons of butter, then add the 6 tablespoons of flour and mix together and let simmer on low heat until it turns a slight golden color.</li>
        <li>Next, add the 4 cups of milk to the pot in segments. As you add the milk slowly in increments, stir it in with the butter/flour rue that you created. Use a whisk to stir.</li>
        <li>After stirring in the Milk, add the rest of the dry ingredients and let the mix simmer on medium heat until the milk cooks down a bit.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid mix loses a little volume, start adding the cheeses, leaving 4oz of the cheddar and 4oz of mozzerella to the side for the topping. </li>
        <li>After stirring the cheese sauce until all the clumps are gone and the sauce is smooth, pour the cooked elbow noodles into the cheese sauce and stir until all noodles are coated.</li>
        <li>Next, pour the mixture into a 9'X13' pyrex or ceramic baking dish.</li>
        <li>Use the remaining shredded cheese and layer it on top of the mixture.</li>
        <li>Place the dish on the middle rack of your preheated oven and bake for 35-45 minutes depending on how golden you like the top crust. If you have an older oven, or you live in a higher altitude, you might consider a longer baking time or using the broil function for the last 5-10 minutes of bake time.</li>
        <li>When the mac is done baking, pull the dish out of the oven and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes before serving. This time will help let the egg settle in the mac to make this dish more firm.</li>
    </ol>
