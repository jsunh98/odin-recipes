    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 fresh nectarines, pitted and halved</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, divided</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons brown sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of nuts, salted or unsalted, pick your favorite nut. Great with walnuts, pecans, or pistachios</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of gorgonzola or feta cheese</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>pinch of cracked black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place butter in microwave save dish and heat unti melted</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Brush all sides of your halved nectarines with the melted butter</li>
        <li>Place all of the nectarines halves open side down on the grill. Leave them on until you get good grill marks.</li>
        <li>Once you have a good char on the open halves, turn them over and brush them again with some of the melted butter.</li>
        <li>For 4 of the halves, fill each empty pit cavity with the gorgonzola/feta cheese, then top off the whole surface of the open half with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>For the other 4 halves, you can prep this 2 ways, either mix the brown sugar with your preferred nuts in a small pot or skillet, mix with butter and heat them up that way, or you can place the nuts in the pitted area of the remaining nectarines and then covered the nuts and surround surface area with brown sugar. Either way works.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The nectarines are ready when the cheese is melted and creamy on the savory side nectarines, and the sugars are melted on the dessert nectarines. Try serving the dessert version with your favorite ice cream.</p>
